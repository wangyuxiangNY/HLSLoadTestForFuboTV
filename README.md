# HLSLoadTestForFuboTV
## Project to demo how to load-test fuboTV HLS utilizing jmeter API 

### How to run: 
Pull the code to your machine and modify the path to where your jmeter installed(This proptery can be put in property file, but to save time...I simply hard-coded it), and run it as a java application. 

The HLS_Test.jmx will be generated at the end of run.
